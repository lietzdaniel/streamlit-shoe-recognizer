# streamlit-shoe-recognizer
This streamlit application was built by training the model set up in [this](https://github.com/lietzdaniel/shoe-recognizer) repository. It has the goal of classifying the model of the sneaker in the image uploaded by the user. 

##Functionality 
The streamlit application can be accessed [here](https://lietzdaniel-streamlit-shoe-recognizer-frontendstreamlit-bvk8g6.streamlit.app/).
To use it, you simply upload an image with a sneaker in the designated button, and wait a few seconds until it shows you the most likely predicition based on the model for your uploaded image.
